        <div class="panel">
            <p>My full name is Maryam Khalidah Agnes Janssen. I'm 20 years old, born on 30/05/2001 in Geleen in the
                Netherlands. I'm an introvert but very weird with close people and like to be funny.
                A small backstory about me is that I have a Malaysian mother and a Dutch father. I've been raised in the
                Netherlands and moved to Belgium back in 2015 when I was 14 years old.
                I have family members in the Netherlands and a big family in Malaysia from my mother's side. I also have
                one younger brother, Zacharia who is 19 years old.
                Another fact about me? I'm a muslim as well!

                <div>
                    <p>I myself don't have one specific thing I can consider as a like. I have passion for a lot of
                        things.
                        I
                        always hear people saying that they have been passionate with one thing since they were small.
                        For me, that's not the case. I have a lot of interests since I was small and discovered many
                        more
                        even
                        when I was a teenager.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>One thing I adore to do is singing, it gives me energy and I enjoy it very much.
                        I also enjoy writing stories, wrote a lot of fantasy stories about either my teddy bears or any
                        character since I was very small, I remember coming up with one when I was 6 years old I
                        believe, I
                        would get inspired with many things with it,
                        either stories I've heard, things happening in life or even movies. Now I enjoy to write stories
                        on
                        Wattpad as a corner to let out some passion there as well. I also enjoy drawing, would sometimes
                        randomly draw anything anywhere.
                        I enjoy dancing as well, I've taken dance classes when I was a child and now sometimes dance to
                        songs,
                        even k-pop songs. One of my newest is editing, I've always been curious about editing and have
                        been
                        editing for a few years, mostly simple edits.
                        It's either a picture or a video.</p>

                    <p>
                        I also love music, I'm a huge BTS fan and would sing or even fangirl
                        about them a lot, some people wouldn't understand me with that particular like I have. I'm also
                        a
                        huge
                        fan of Cimorelli, a girl band. I love these two groups a lot for their positive messages in
                        their
                        music.
                        I also enjoy listening to any type of music, especially k-pop or a song with a positive message
                        mostly.</p>

                    <p>
                        I also love food a lot but to be more specific, I am in love with noodles ever since I was a
                        child.
                        I'm
                        more into spicy food as I enjoy more Asian dishes over western ones. My mother would cook a lot
                        of
                        different dishes I love. I've been loving her food ever since I was small. One I adore is
                        chicken
                        curry,
                        she cooks it very well. My mom told me that she ate hot food when she was pregnant with me.

        <a class="accordion"><u>Why multimedia</u></a>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>It took me a very long time to think of what I really wanted to do. A little backstory. Back in school, I
                studied accounting. I have a TSO diploma of accounting and informatics. I used to think that I would
                want to continue my studies in accounting because my mother did.
                Accounting surely was interesting but I wasn't certain myself if I truly saw myself with it in the
                future, especially either in college or university. I wasn't sure myself if I would wanted to go to
                university.
                I was very stuck and thought on what truly interested me. I did realize that I edited a lot and did my
                hobby a lot. I thought of graphic design as an option. I searched around online for a nice course, using
                the keywords "graphic design" and
                found this one
                from Erasmus. I immediately wanted to sign up after reading what this one was about, finding a lot of
                things in here very interesting. I enjoy my courses here even though it's a bit difficult
                but I enjoy practical courses a lot (maybe a bit more than theory lessons).</p>

        <a class="accordion"><u>My job (and experiences)</u></a>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Now that I'm 20 I do have some experiences when it comes to working. I've taken summerjobs at Scania IT.
                Scania is a truck company, I have taken a job in the IT section. My job for two summers was to install
                laptops and PC's. Since then I got more interested in anything IT related. I've taken a two week
                internship in i-City in my 6th year as well. It's because in TSO we need to take interships in our 5th
                and 6th year (the one from 5th year got cancelled thanks to corona). As I was struggling to find a
                stable job last summer, my brother suggested me Mise en Place, a job in the catering industry where we
                would work at different places in Belgium. I work in that industry right now. It gave me a lot of
                opportunities to see different kinds of events like football, a wedding, ceremonies, many different
                types of jobs. I gotta admit, it's pretty tiring but well payed. It doesn't have a scedule like a
                full-time or parttime job. It's an interim job. I can just plan it in when I can take a shift as a shift
                can take either 4
                hours or 11 hours. I can either be in Brussels, Gent, Brugge, anywhere (even though I most likely pick
                locations from Brussels).</p>
